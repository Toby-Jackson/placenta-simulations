Welcome to our 'Virtual Pregnancy'
==================================

Welcome to the Pregnancy Modelling team at Auckland Bioengineering Institute ('The  ABI Placenta
Group').

About our Group
---------------

The `Pregnancy Modelling Group` is a research group focusing developing computational models that contribute to a `Virtual
Pregnancy`.
It was established by Dr Alys Clark (Auckland Bioengineering Institute, University of Auckland) and Dr Joanna James
(Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, University of Auckland)
in around 2012.

Since establishment of the group we have been grateful to receive funding from a number of sources to create the virtual pregnancy.
These funding sources include The Royal Society of New Zealand Te Aparangi via the Marsden Fund, the Catalyst Fund,
and the Rutherford Discovery Fellowship programme, the Wellcome Leap In Utero Program, The Health Research Council of New Zealand Consolidator Fund, The Gravida Centre of Research Excellence,
The Aotearoa Foundation, The Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences (University of Auckland), and Auckland Bioengineering Institute (University of Auckland).

Examples of our Computational Models
------------------------------------

We use three main libraries to develop our and run our models, although some examples will include other libraries
and softwares (preferably open-source):

	1. The placentagen libraries, found `at this link <https://github.com/VirtualPregnancy/placentagen.git>`_.
	2. The reprosim libraries, found `at this link <https://github.com/VirtualPregnancy/reprosim.git>`_.
	3. The OpenCMISS libraries, found `at this link <hhttp://opencmiss.org/>`_.

This set of examples focuses on formulating the steps toward creating and solving models of placental and utero-placental structure and function. The set of examples will grow as our capabilities expand.
