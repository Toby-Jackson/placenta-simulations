Generating computational geometries that represent the anatomy of pregnancy
===========================================================================
This set of examples demonstrates the steps toward creating geometric models that represent anatomies that
are measured in pregnancy. This includes generation of vascular trees, and finite element meshes from
a number of different sources of information including morphometric data, and imaging data.
